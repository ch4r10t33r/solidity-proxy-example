Write a contract, with a constructor that takes 2 arguments: an address of ERC20 token and an array of address (wallets of users). The contract allows any amount of tokens to be sent to it and the amount of token send to the contract should be split equally to all addresses given in the constructor. Token can be withdrawn by users using the appropriate function.
